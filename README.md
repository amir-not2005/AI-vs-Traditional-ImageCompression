# AI-vs-Traditional-ImageCompression

## Comparative Study of Traditional and AI-based Image Compression Methods

This repository contains a research paper comparing traditional image compression techniques with AI-based models, focusing on compression efficiency and image quality.

## Overview

The paper evaluates two traditional methods, **JPEG** and **HEIF**, alongside three AI-based models from the **CompressAI** library:
- **cheng2020-anchor**
- **mbt2018-mean**
- **bmshj2018-hyperprior**  

The goal is to evaluate how well AI-driven models can perform against traditional approaches in terms of compression ratio and image quality (measured using metrics like PSNR and SSIM). These metrics help compare the efficiency and quality retention of both traditional and AI-based compression methods.
